Our code read the input file and store the content in a buffer. Then we parse 
the buffer, two characters by two characters, and at the same time separate the 
operators and the rest of the commands. We then pass the tokens to the function
parse_chunk_to_command and parse_pair_to_operator_command and store them into 
struct command. All these populated struct commands are stored in a linked list 
of command_nodes. Then we go through this linked list and use the 
infix-to-postfix algorithm to link them in trees. In the end every command is in
a tree and they are all linked in a linked-list by their roots. After all these,
we pass this linked list to the print_command function and print them out :D 

In terms of division of work, we pair programmed the entire project.
