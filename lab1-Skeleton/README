This is a skeleton for CS 111 Lab 1.

Our code read the input file and store the content in a buffer. Then we parse the buffer, two characters by two characters, and at the same time seperate the operators and the rest of the commands. We then pass them to the function parse_chunk_to_command and parse_pair_to_operator_command and store them into struct command. All these populated struct commands are stored in a linked list of command_nodes. Then we go through this linked list and use the infix-to-postfix algorithm to link them in trees. In the end every command is in a tree and they are all linked in a linked-list by their roots. After all these, we pass this linked list to the print_command function and print them out :D
